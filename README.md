# Analysis-of-USA-Cars-Dataset
This project explores the USA Cars dataset, analyzing trends in car pricing, mileage, brand prevalence, and title statuses. The dataset is used to answer key questions and generate visual insights for better understanding

Objectives
The Project main goal is to analyze and answer the question below:
1. What is the average price of vehicles listed in the dataset?
2. Which brand has the highest number of listings?
3. What is the average mileage of cars by brand and model?
4. How does the average price vary between clean and salvage title vehicles?
5. Are newer models (e.g., after 2015) priced significantly higher than older ones?
6. What is the price difference between cars with the same model but different colors?
7. Which state has the highest average price for vehicles?
8. Are there specific brands more prevalent in certain states?
9.  Do cars with fewer days left have lower prices compared to recently listed vehicles?
